### \*OmniDisc_FS -list

## OmniDisc_Icon

This command is used to manage the icons displayed for the drives.

### \*OmniDisc_Icon -add <sprite> [-fs <fsname>] [-disc <discname>] [-drives <drives list>]

Sets the icon to use for the specified drives. The icon must exist in the wimp sprite pool.

The `-fs`, `-disc` and `-drives` are all optional, and if not specified the icon will be used for 'any' of the missing specifier. The drives list is a string of drives to apply the icon to. eg '45' would match drives 4 and 5, '0123' would match all the 'floppy' discs.

examples:
... `-fs ADFS` will use the given sprite for all ADFS drives.  
... `-fs SCSI -disc MyDisc` will use it for MyDisc on SCSI.  
... `-fs SCSI -drives 4` will use it for drive 4 on SCSI.  
... `-fs SDFS -disc MyCard -drives 0` will use it for a disc called MyCard on SDFS drive 0.  

When more than one icon can be used, the more specific one will be picked.
